Speech-to-Text Transcription- AI Project

## Project Title:

Speech-to-Text Transcription using Python and SpeechRecognition API


## Objective:

To build a simple AI-based tool that converts audio (from microphone or file) into readable and savable text using Python's SpeechRecognition library.


## Introduction:

Speech recognition is a key AI application that allows machines to interpret and respond to human speech. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a speech-to-text transcription system using the Google Web Speech API via Python.


## Tools and Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

# SpeechRecognition – for handling audio and performing transcription

# PyAudio – for accessing the microphone

# Wave – for reading .wav audio files


Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Platform: Windows


## Project Workflow:

# Audio Input

Option 1: Real-time input using microphone

Option 2: Pre-recorded .wav file


# Speech Recognition

Audio is processed using recognize_google() from the SpeechRecognition library.


# Output

Transcribed text is printed and saved to a .txt file.



## Results

Successfully transcribed speech from microphone and .wav file.

Output was accurate for clear audio and stored in transcription.txt.



## Conclusion

This project showcases the practical use of speech recognition in AI by implementing a working model that transcribes audio into text. It provides a strong foundation for further development in voice-based applications.
